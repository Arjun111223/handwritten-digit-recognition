# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to recognize handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of digits from 0 to 9. The project demonstrates how to preprocess images, train a CNN, and make predictions on new images provided by the user.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization of pixel values and reshaping of images.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN built with multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dense layers.
- **Training**: Model training on the MNIST dataset for digit classification.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy and loss tracking across training epochs, and final model evaluation on test data.
- **User Interaction**: Ability for users to upload an image of a handwritten digit and receive a prediction from the trained model.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras**: For model layers and training functions.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training accuracy and loss.
- **Google Colab**: For running the notebook with a user-friendly image upload feature.
